## 📊 Calorie Calculation

Calories are calculated using the MET formula:
```
Calories = (MET × 3.5 × Your Weight × Minutes) / 200
```

**MET Values by Goal:**
- 🏋️ Muscle Gain: 6.0
- 🔥 Fat Loss: 8.0
- 💪 Body Toning: 5.0
- 🏃 Endurance: 7.0

**Example:**
- Weight: 70 kg
- Goal: Fat Loss (MET 8)
- Duration: 45 minutes
- **Calories Burned**: (8 × 3.5 × 70 × 45) / 200 = **441 calories**
